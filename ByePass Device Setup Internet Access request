Microsoft removed the 'BypassNRO.cmd'  script from Windows 11 preview builds, which allowed users to bypass the Microsoft Account requirement when installing the operating system.
Try the below new method.
When installing Windows 11 and you reach the screen asking, "Let's connect you to a network," you can use the Shift+F10 keyboard combination to open a Windows command prompt.
At this prompt, type "start ms-cxh:localonly" and press Enter on your keyboard to open a "Microsoft account" window where you can create a new local user for the Windows 11
